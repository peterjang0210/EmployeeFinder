## Technologies Used
For the frontend, vanilla javascript is used for the logic necessary to compare the user input with the employees' results, jQuery is used to make the API calls (ajax),and Bootstrap is used as the framework. In addition, font awesome was used to add logos where necessary. On the backend, node.js was utilized as the run time environment. The express package was utilized to initialize the server on the machine. The various APIs were built by passing the app variable and creating call back functions that linked to various routes.
